This repository contains configurations gathered from a variety of videos on YouTube. Kudos to Let's Learn YT (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JqxghWCCiI) for inspiring me to actually log my progress on GitHub. Thank you for providing your initial configurations to the SD-WAN lab. 

Although I have setup the SD-WAB lab on CML, this will be my firt time using Eve-NG for any lab.
